1) WaitFor causes "MutationObserver is not a constructor while using waitFor"

From https://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-3/testing-asynchronous-react-rtl.html
Seeing Errors?
If you’re getting the error TypeError: MutationObserver is not a constructor while using waitFor, it’s not your fault.
Depending on the day you are writing your test, the version of Jest that comes with create-react-app might be different from the version that React Testing Library expects you to have.
Here is how to solve it for now:
Run npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen to install a more recent version of Jest.
Change the test script in the package.json file to be: "test": "react-scripts test --env=jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen"

I also changed the run configuration in Intellij to add --env=jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen

2) Example of testing with routing
https://testing-library.com/docs/example-react-router

3) waitFor example:
await waitFor(() => { expect(container.querySelector("span#info_span")!.innerHTML).to.eq('cat') })
